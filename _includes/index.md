## Priorities

While hacking, please keep in mind these priorities, in order of importance:

1. Listen and learn
2. Share knowledge and techniques
3. Try new things and gain new knowledge/insights
4. Have fun/team building
5. Produce usable code or demos

Priorities #1-4 are **essential**.  Priority #5 would be nice to have.

## Goals 💯

The goal of this hack trip will be to jointly develop a new Arches package.  Going through this process should help us:
- identify problem areas or potential improvements in key Arches functionalities, including:
	- package creation process
	- development of datatypes, widgets and functions
	- intergration with external systems
- help individual developers gain a broader understanding of Arches (and Arches package development)
- prototype integrations and/or use cases that could be helpful in demoing Arches
- prototype a package that might actually be useful IRL

Along the way, keep in mind that this is an opportunity to gain a broader understanding of Arches as well as share your unique knowledge of Arches with your fellow developers.  We should also strive to capture potential improvements and enhancements to Arches as tickets in [GitHub](https://github.com/archesproject/arches).

The use case that we will be targeting in this hack trip will be address management, similar to the San Francisco EAS.  We should strive to make this exercise as real-world as possible, therefore, we should plan to use real SF address, parcel and street data in our efforts.

## Teams

Group should be split into three teams working in 1-2 hour sprints on a given task. Teams will check in for 5-15 minutes between each sprint to see where things are at and plan next tasks.

Teams should strive to hack together, on a single machine at a time.  The driver role should rotate every 20-30 minutes and each member should drive at least once per sprint.

Members should feel free to change team membership or reorganize teams as needed during the hack day.

## Code organization

Coding will be done in branches of the [`fargeo/southlake`](https://github.com/fargeo/southlake) repo.

Each team will code in a separate branch, merging into `master` as needed.

Should we decide/need to do core Arches development, that work will be done in branches of the [`fargeo/arches` fork](https://github.com/fargeo/arches).

Instead of cloning the `fargeo/arches` fork, it is probably much easier to just change remote on your existing local arches repo.

## Preparation

Please do the following before arriving:

- re-read this page (it's being updated daily)
- add or suggest food/drink places and/or activities (below)
- clone the [`fargeo/southlake`](https://github.com/fargeo/southlake) repo and set it up as a local Arches package.
- think about the address management use case in the context of Arches:
	- how to model data?
	- datatypes/widgets?
	- functions?
	- integrations?
